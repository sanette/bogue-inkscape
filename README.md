# Bogue-inkscape

_Use the nice [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) drag-and-drop interface to easily create
beautiful [Bogue](https://github.com/sanette/bogue) GUI designs._

## Short description

This library (and command line utility) reads an Inkscape SVG file,
and writes Bogue code automatically that transforms the Inkscape
objects into Bogue widgets. Of course,

+ only specific Inkscape objects are recognized (see below), and
+ the code must then be manually completed to add the logic of your GUI program.

In other words, Inkscape becomes a _helper program_ that you use to
create the Bogue GUI _design_. See examples below.

## Goal

Use Inkscape to help code Bogue designs.

## Non-goals

+ ~~Import any Inkscape file.~~ If you think this will transform any
  Inkscape document into a Bogue GUI, you will be severly
  disappointed.

+ ~~Program the whole GUI with Inkscape.~~ You will only use Inkscape to
  create the GUI _design_, that is, the position and decoration of the
  various widgets. Yes, in fact you can also help creating
  _connections_, but you will still have to program the heart of your
  code by hand.
